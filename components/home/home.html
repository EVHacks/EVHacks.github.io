  <h1>WHAT’S A HACKATHON?</h1>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch — these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and robots.”</p>

  <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
</div>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li><h4>What if I don’t know how to code?</h4>
    You do not need to know how to code! We will be hosting a variety of workshops throughout the day such as making your own website from scratch using html/css and more advanced workshops. In addition, we will have mentors, both on-site and virtually.</li>
    <li><h4>Who can participate at this event?</h4>
    This hackathon is open to high school students only. If you already graduated from high school and you would like to be a mentor, please fill out this form and we will reach out to you shortly.</li>
    <li><h4>How much does this event cost?</h4>
    Thanks to our generous sponsors and support from our school’s administration, admission is free! We will provide you WiFi, meals, swag, and workspace.</li>
    <li><h4>How do I form or join a team?</h4>
    It’s best to form a team prior to the hackathon since we’ll only have around 11+ hours to hack; utilize the Facebook events page to find your future hack buddies!</li>
    <li><h4>What else should I do to prep for the hackathon?</h4>
    Get plenty of sleep the night before, shower and use deodorant. Steeping in a room with 150+ people for 12 hours can get gnarly, so keep yourself clean!</li>
    <li><h4>Is there a code of conduct and a waiver I need to read and sign?</h4>
    We’re glad you asked.  The waiver will be posted soon and the code of conduct can be found here.</li>
  </ol>
